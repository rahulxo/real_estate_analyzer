# Real Estate Price Predictor 🏠

This is a beginner-friendly data science project where I built a machine learning model to predict housing prices. I used Python to clean the data, explore trends, and train a regression model that estimates home value based on key features.

## 🔍 What it does
- Loads real estate data from a Kaggle dataset
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Visualizes housing trends like price vs. square footage
- Trains a machine learning model using XGBoost
- Shows which home features most impact sale price

## 📌 Why I made this
I'm a finance major learning data science, and I wanted to build something that connects both. Real estate is something I’m interested in, and this project helped me understand how to apply Python and machine learning to real-world financial data.
