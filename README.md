# Real Estate Price Predictor üè†

This is a beginner-friendly data science project where I built a machine learning model to predict housing prices. I used Python to clean the data, explore trends, and train a regression model that estimates home value based on key features.

## What it does
- Loads real estate data from Kaggle
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
- Visualizes trends like price vs. square footage
- Trains a regression model using XGBoost
- Highlights which home features impact price the most

## Why I made this
I'm a finance major learning data science, and I wanted to build something that connects both. Real estate is something I‚Äôm interested in, and this project helped me learn how data science can be used in pricing and valuation.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizing data)
- scikit-learn & XGBoost (for machine learning)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## How to run the project

1. **Download the dataset**  
   Go to the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and download the file called `train.csv`.

2. **Place the file in the right folder**  
   Inside your project folder, create a folder named `data` (if it doesn't already exist), and move the `train.csv` file into it.
